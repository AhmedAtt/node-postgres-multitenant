## Description

A POC of a multitenant BE architecture using Node.js and Postgres. 

This doesn't offer full separation of data between tenants, which is recommended to avoid leakage of data between tenants, this is a starting point to understand how to create a B2B SAAS, having different companies, with users assigned to each company, while being able to register/sign in and access the company dashboard.
